#Q1 1. Handle the exception thrown by the code below by using try and except blocks.
for i in ['a','b','c']:
 print(i**2)
 
for i in ['a','b','c']:
 print(i**2)

try:
    for i in ['a', 'b', 'c']:
        print(i**2)
except Exception:
    print("Cannot square non-numeric characters")
    
#Q2 2. Write a function that asks for an integer and prints the square of it. Use a while loop with a try,
except, else block to account for incorrect inputs.
This should be the output of your function:
Input an integer: “hello”
Unrecognized number! Please try again!
Input an integer: 2
You entered 2, your number squared is: 4

try:
    x = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
    sqr = x ** 2
    print(f"You entered {x}, your number squared is {sqr}.")
except:
    print("Unrecognized number! Please try again!")
    
#Q3  3. Complete the Line class given below. Your class should accept two sets of coordinate points as
tuples. Write two methods within the class, one to compute distance between two points, and
another to compute the slope.
You have to complete the code given below:
class Line:
 def __init__(self,coordinateA,coordinateB):
 pass
 def distance(self):
 pass
 def slope(self):
 pass
Example output:
c1 = (3, 2)
c2 = (8, 10)
myline = Line(c1, c2)



class Line:
    dis = 0
    
    def __init__(self, coordinateA, coordinateB):
        self.a = coordinateA[0]
        self.b = coordinateB[0]
        self.c = coordinateA[1]
        self.d = coordinateB[1]
    
    def distance(self):
        return ((self.b - self.a)**2 + (self.d - self.c)**2)**0.5
    
    def slope(self):
        self.distance
        try:
            return ((self.d-self.c)/(self.b-self.a))
        except Exception:
            return print("Infinity")
    
c1 = (3,2)
c2 = (8,10)
myLine = Line(c1, c2)

print(myLine.distance())
print(myLine.slope())

#Q4 4. Complete the class given below:
class Cylinder:
 
 def __init__(self,height=1,radius=1):
 pass
 
 def volume(self):
 pass
 
 def surface_area(self):
 pass


class Cylinder:
    def __init__(self,height=1,radius=1):
        self.hei = height
        self.rad = radius
        
    def volume(self):
        return 3.14 * self.rad ** 2 * self.hei
    
    def surface_area(self):
        return 2 * 3.14 * self.rad * (self.rad + self.hei)
    
h = 20
r = 10
cyl = Cylinder(h ,r)
print(cyl.volume())
print(cyl.surface_area())


#Q5 5. Define a class InputOutString which has at least two methods: getString: to get a string from
console input, printString: to print the string in upper case. Also please include simple test function
to test the class methods.

class InputOutString:
    
    def getString(self):
        y = input("Enter a string: ")
        self.y = y
    
    def printString(self):
        self.getString()
        upr = self.y.upper()
        print(upr)

x = InputOutString()
x.printString()

#Q6 6. Write a python program to copy the contents of one file to another. Your new file should be
named as old file name followed by a 1. For example: if your original file is named: myfile.txt, your
new file should be named: myfile1.txt

with open('myfile.txt',"r") as f, open('myfile1.txt',"w") as f1:
    for line in f:
        f1.write(line)
        
        
#Q7 7. Write a lambda function that takes in two numbers, and returns the sum of the squares of the
input numbers.
Example: If your input is 2, 3, your output should be : 22
 + 32 i.e. 13

num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
x = lambda a, b : a ** 2 + b ** 2
print(x(num1,num2))
